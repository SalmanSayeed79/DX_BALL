## Problem Statement

This was the final term final project for “CSE 102 | Structured Programming Language Sessional” course. We were told to implement one of three games that was randomly given among : 
1. Catch The Egg
2. DX Ball
3. Pacman

I was assigned to develop DX Ball. There were no problem statements given. Everything was open for interpretation. Only developing the core game functionality was enough for this project. With some additional requirements like “save game” functionality

I developed the game with menu, extreme mode powerups as well as with audio support.

## Features

- Regular Gamplay

## Stack

iGraphics Framework [Based on OpenGL]

## My solution

I had implemented all the core features and included an extra “Game Mode” where the ball would be treated as a PONG ball and we could control the PONG paddles with different buttons on the keyboard

Extra Features 

- PONG Game
- Ball moves along curve instead of line
- Scoring System
- Multiplayer
    - w,s For player 1
    - UP, DOWN for player 2
